# Kv-storage
This is an extremely simple key-value storage application that is interacted with via the cli. It is extremely simple and i've just had it sitting around and wanted to put it up on github.

## Usage
Just execute ```cargo run``` after cloning the repo.
Use ``` set [key] [value] ``` to add a value, ``` get [key] ``` to retrieve a certain key, and ``` del [key] ``` to remove a key.
